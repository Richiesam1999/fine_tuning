Longer term stability is aided \nby the advanced coatings on the implant surfaces which are \ndesigned for biological integration of the bone. The overall \ndesign geometry of the implants facilitates a congruent transfer \nof the weight load and restoring the range of motion.\nThe system comprises of both cemented and uncemented \nfemoral stems, cementless acetabular cups designed to be used \nwith highly crosslinked polyethylene modular liners and a choice \nof either Biolox\u00ae or Cobalt Chrome head options in multiple \nhead diameters and offset options. The variety of component \nand size options enable surgeons to provide patients with the \nbest hip arthroplasty solutions without compromise.\nTHE LIBERTAS HIP FAMILY 23\nOVERVIEWBiological \nStabilityMechanical \nStability\nBone  \nConservationCongruent \nStress Transfer4\nTHE LIBERTAS HIP FAMILYUNCEMENTED STEM\n3 Offset Options\nto facilitate restoration of hip biomechanics\nTapered neck  \ndesigned to increase range of motion\nLateral shoulder  \ndesigned for ease of insertion\nStep design  \nto maximize compression loading in cancellous bone\nTrapezoidal cross section \ndesigned for initial stability\nHA coated stems  \nin 33 size options\nVertical grooves  \ndesigned for rotational and axial stability\nRectangular cross section  \ndesigned for rotational stability\nMATERIAL SPECIFICATIONS\nSTEM\n\u2022 Titanium Alloy (Ti6Al4V\u2013 ELI) with \nOsprovit\u00ae Hydroxyapatite coating \napplied as a plasma spray\nOSPROVIT \u00ae  COATING DETAILS\n\u2022 Surface roughness: Rt > 30 \u00b5m\n\u2022 Coating thickness: 150 \u00b1 40 \u00b5m\n\u2022 Coating adhesion strength: \u2265 15 Mpa\n\u2022 Crystallinity: \u2265 60%5\nOVERVIEWCEMENTED STEM\n2 Offset Options\nto facilitate restoration of hip biomechanics\nPolished, double tapered design\nStainless steel stems \nin 9 size options\nWinged and non winged centralizer options\nMATERIAL SPECIFICATIONS\nSTEM\n\u2022 High Nitrogen Stainless Steel \nconforming to ISO 5832-9:20076\nTHE LIBERTAS HIP FAMILYTAPER REDUCED STEM\n3 Offset Options\nto facilitate restoration of hip biomechanics\nTapered neck  \ndesigned to increase range of motion\nHighly polished neck\ndesigned to minimize soft tissue damage & liner wear\nLateral shoulder  \ndesigned for ease of insertion\n Ti-GrowthC\u00ae* coating \ndesigned for initial stability\nComprehensive sizes   \nwith 18 sizes in each offset option \nDistal reduction \ndesigned for better fit in proximal / distal mismatch\nVertical grooves  \ndesigned for rotational and axial stability\nMATERIAL SPECIFICATIONS\nSTEM\n\u2022 Titanium Alloy (Ti6Al4V \u2013 ELI) with       \nTi-GrowthC\u00ae coating applied as a \nplasma spray\nTi-GROWTHC\u00ae  COATING DETAILS\n\u2022 Surface roughness: Rt 300 -

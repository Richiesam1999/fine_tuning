INTRODUCTION TO  
THE LIBERTAS® HIP SYSTEM
• Comprehensive range of implants for restoring hip 
biomechanics
• Facilitates congruent transfer of loads
• Designed for mechanical and biological stability
The Libertas® Total Hip System offers a comprehensive range 
of modular implants that facilitates stable restoration of hip 
biomechanics across a varied range of patient demographics. 
The implants are designed to provide immediate mechanical 
stability while preserving bone. Longer term stability is aided 
by the advanced coatings on the implant surfaces which are 
designed for biological integration of the bone. The overall 
design geometry of the implants facilitates a congruent transfer 
of the weight load and restoring the range of motion.
The system comprises of both cemented and uncemented 
femoral stems, cementless acetabular cups designed to be used 
with highly crosslinked polyethylene modular liners and a choice 
of either Biolox® or Cobalt Chrome head options in multiple 
head diameters and offset options. The variety of component 
and size options enable surgeons to provide patients with the 
best hip arthroplasty solutions without compromise.
